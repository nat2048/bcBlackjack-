        <h2>Bondage Club Dice Blackjack</h2>
        <p>Site is WIP.</p>
        <p>By playing you consent to stuff listed in rules and prizes</p>
        <p>Safewords will be respected</p>

        <h3>Basic rules</h3>
        <p>All players begin with 50 tokens, display and keep count of them on a sign</p>
        <p>The minimum bet is 20 tokens</p>
        <p>The game uses a 10-sided die (/dice 10). Numbers 2-10 are worth their face value. The number 1 acts like an Ace (1 or 11, whichever is beneficial).</p>
        <p>The goal is to be closest to 21 without going over</p>>
        <p>After betting dealer rolls one die, players take two initial rolls and then decide: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>hit - take another roll, can be repeated until reaching 21 or over</li>
                <li>stand - keep current rolls, can be used after hitting or splitting</li>
                <li>double down - double the bet and take one more roll then stand</li>
                <li>split - only if initial rolls have same value, double your bet and create two separate hands, each gets one more initial roll and then decide again</li>
            </ul>
        <p>After each player stands or busts(gets over 21) dealer takes their rolls until they reach 17 or bust.</p>
        <p>If you don't have enough tokens to bet you can get a loan, if you win you get the amount you loaned, if you lose you bankrupt</p>
        <h3>Bankrupcy & Jail</h3>
        <p>If player bankrupts they are jailed and presented with a decision: wait or play</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wait - you wait to be bought by another player but they might keep you for a while</li>
            <li>Play - you start again with 40 tokens, 10 minimum bet and you are forced to play every round, you need to earn tokens to free yourself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jailed players can be bought by free players but if they decide to play their price is increased by 50 tokens</p>
        <p>If jailed player bankrupts again they get they can play again with 10 fewer tokens but their price drops by 50</p>
        <p>If player bankrupts 5 times they lose and their fate is up to the dealer</p>
