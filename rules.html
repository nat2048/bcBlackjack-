                <li>The goal is to roll higher than dealer without rolling higher than 21</li>
                <li>Everybody can be a dealer but owner and staff(WIP) have priority</li>
                <li>Stand on red, grab a sign and write 50 on it to become player</li>
                <li></li>
                <li><b>1.</b>Dealer takes the bets. Minimum bet is 20 tokens. If you have no money for minimal bet casino can give you a loan(if you win you keep the won amount)</li>
                <li><b>2.</b>Dealer rolls one dice and players roll 2 dices.</li>
                <li><b style="color:orange;">Roll values: </b>1 = ace, value 1 or 11 benefitial to player | 2-9 value equal to number | 10 = king/queen/jack, value 10</li>

                        <li>- hit(nod): you roll another dice (one at a time) until you bust or choose to stand</li>
                        <li>- double down(giggle): you double your bet and take <b>one</b> more roll</li>
                        <li>- split(mumble): if dealt two cards of the same value you can put second bet and each card becomes a separate hand</li>
                        <li>- surrender(groan): if you don't like your initial hand you can surrender for half of your bet</li>
                    </ul>
                    21 in initial deal = instant 3:2 of your bet
                    Same amount as dealer = keep your bet
