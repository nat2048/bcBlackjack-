            <h3>Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dice Blackjack combines traditional blackjack rules with dice rolls.</li>
                <li>The goal is to roll higher than dealer without rolling higher than 21</li>
                <li>Everybody can be a dealer but owner and staff(WIP) have priority</li>
                <li>If played on a map stand on red and grab a sign to become player</li>
                <li></li>
                <li><b>1. Betting phase</b> First the dealer takes the bets. Minimum bet is 20 tokens(dealer dependent). If player have insufficient tokens for minimum bet casino gives them a loan.</li>
                <li><b>2. Initial deal</b> Now the dealer rolls one dice and players roll 2 dices. Dealer combines results and presents them to players.</li>
                <li><b style="color:orange;">Roll values: </b>1 = ace, value 1 or 11 benefitial to player | 2-9 value equal to number | 10 = king/queen/jack, value 10</li>
                <li><b>3. Player decision </b>Now player can decide to(for gagged players):
                        <ul>
                        <li>- stand(shake head): you keep your cards and wait until round end</li>
                        <li>- hit(nod): you roll another dice (one at a time) until you bust or choose to stand</li>
                        <li>- double down(giggle): you double your bet and take <b>one</b> more card</li>
                        <li>- split(mumble): if dealt two cards of the same value you can put second bet and each card becomes a separate hand</li>
                        <li>- surrender(groan): if you don't like your initial hand you can surrender half of your bet</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you are dealt 21 in initial deal you get instantly paid 3:2 of your bet
                </li>
                <li><b>4. Dealer play </b>Dealer hits until their bust or reach value of above 17 then they will stand. Then dealer announces winners/losers.</li>
                <li><b>5. Break phase </b>After changing their account values players can spend their tokens on things listed in prices tab. Then another round starts.</li>
                <li>If your account goes into negative check the backrupcy tab</li>
                <li>You roll dice using <b style="color:orange;">/dice 10</b> command. Unless permited by dealer using other dices can be fined.</li>
